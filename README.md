# Seasonal Climate Analysis

## Observations
In order to further determine the feasibility of opening a surf and ice cream shop on the island of Oahu, we performed additional analysis on the months of June and December to determine how the shop might perform in different seasons. Our findings show that there is little variability between seasons on the island and therefore we should experience good business year round.  The mean temperature in June was observed to be 75 degrees and in December 71 degrees while precipitation averaged 0.14 inches and 0.22 inches, respectfully. Standard deviation of temperature was low for both months, 3.75 for December and 3.26 for June.

## Further Analysis
We would want to expand our analysis to include year round statisitics to determine if other seasons, say spring or fall, had different results, such as higher preciptiation or lower minimum temperature. There are also other weather conditions that we could analyze to determine any possible variances in business due to weather on the island. Adding a study of wind conditions and severe weather (such as hurricanes) are two that we would certainly want to add.
